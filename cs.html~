Cybersecurity standards (also styled cyber security standards)[1] are techniques generally set forth in published materials that attempt to protect the cyber environment of a user or organization.[2] This environment includes users themselves, networks, devices, all software, processes, information in storage or transit, applications, services, and systems that can be connected directly or indirectly to networks. The principal objective is to reduce the risks, including prevention or mitigation of cyber-attacks. These published materials consist of collections of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies.
Cyber Security and Information Systems Information Analysis Center (CSIAC) is a United States Department of Defense (DoD) Information Analysis Center (IAC) sponsored by the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). The CSIAC is a consolidation of three predecessor IACs: the Data & Analysis Center for Software (DACS), the Information Assurance Technology IAC (IATAC) and the Modeling & Simulation IAC (MSIAC), with the addition of the Knowledge Management and Information Sharing technical area.[1]

CSIAC, one of three IACs sponsored by DTIC,[2] performs the Basic Center of Operations (BCO) functions necessary to fulfill the mission and objectives applicable to the DoD Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Acquisition communitiesÂ’ needs.[3] These activities focus on the collection, analysis, synthesizing/processing and dissemination of Scientific and Technical Information (STI).

The BCO functions, specifically the collection and dissemination of STI, produce several valuable resources (e.g., reports, tool databases, data collections, etc.) in the CSIAC's core technology areas (Cybersecurity, Information Assurance, Software Engineering, Modeling & Simulation, and Knowledge Management/Information Sharing).

CSIAC's mission is to provide the DoD with a central point of access for Information Assurance and Cybersecurity to include emerging technologies in system vulnerabilities, R&D, models, and analysis to support the development and implementation of effective defense against information warfare attacks.[4]

The CSIAC is chartered to leverage best practices and expertise from government, industry, and academia on cyber security and information technology.
